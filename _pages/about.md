I am a Master's student in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zurich. Currently, I am conducting my Masterâ€™s thesis
research at the Computational Robotics Lab, supervised
by [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html). My project aims on advancing robotic
manipulation of deformable objects through the development of a comprehensive dataset that captures how various soft objects
respond to robotic interaction. If you have any questions or would
like to learn more about my research, please feel free to reach out via email.
